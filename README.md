# EKS Infrastructure with ArgoCD

## Overview
This project implements a production-ready Kubernetes infrastructure on AWS using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles. The implementation focuses on scalability, security, and maintainability, following cloud-native best practices and GitOps methodology.
## ArchitectureA
### Infrastructure Components

#### 1. EKS Cluster

- Managed Kubernetes service reducing operational overhead
- Multi-AZ deployment for high availability
- Optimized node groups configuration


#### 2. Networking

- Custom VPC for network isolation
- Public and private subnets across multiple AZs
- Internet Gateway for external access
- Proper routing and security group configurations


#### 3. Application Load Balancer (ALB)

- Layer 7 load balancing capabilities
- SSL/TLS termination support
- Integration with EKS service discovery
- Health checks and automatic scaling


#### 4. GitOps with ArgoCD

- Declarative configuration management
- Automated deployment pipeline
- Configuration drift detection
- Rollback capabilities


#### 5. Monitoring Stack

- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization
- AlertManager for notifications
- Custom dashboards and alerts



### Security Measures

- IAM roles with least privilege principle
- Network isolation with security groups
- Pod security policies
- Network policies for inter-pod communication
- KMS encryption for secrets

### Technical Decisions
### Why Terraform?

#### 1. Infrastructure as Code

- Version controlled infrastructure
- Reproducible deployments
- Documentation as code
- State management


#### 2. Modular Structure

- Reusable components
- Environment separation
- Easy maintenance
- Clear dependencies



### Why EKS?

#### 1. Managed Service Benefits

- Automatic updates
- AWS integration
- Simplified management
- Enterprise support


#### 2. Kubernetes Features

- Container orchestration
- Auto-scaling
- Self-healing
- Service discovery



### Why ArgoCD?

#### 1. GitOps Advantages

- Single source of truth
- Automated synchronization
- Audit trail
- Easy rollbacks


#### 2. Operational Benefits

- Declarative configuration
- Configuration drift prevention
- Multi-cluster support
- UI and CLI interfaces
